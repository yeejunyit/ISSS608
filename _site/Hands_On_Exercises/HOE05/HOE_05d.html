<section id="overview" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Parallel coordinates plots are data visualisations specially designed for visualising and analysing multivariate, numerical data. It is ideal for comparing multiple variables at once and seeing the relationships between them. For example, we can see how the variables contribute to the Happiness Index. Parallel coordinates was invented by <a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~aiisreal/">Alfred Inselberg</a> in the 1970s as a way to visualize high-dimensional data. This data visualisation technique is more often found in academic and scientific communities than in business and consumer data visualizations. As pointed out in <a href="https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/b-eye/parallel_coordinates.pdf">Stephen Few (2006)</a>, “This certainly isn’t a chart that you would present to the board of directors or place on your Web site for the general public. In fact, the strength of parallel coordinates isn’t in their ability to communicate some truth in the data to others, but rather in their ability to bring meaningful multivariate patterns and comparisons to light when used interactively for analysis.” For example, a parallel coordinates plot can be used to characterise clusters detected during customer segmentation.</p>

<li><code>scale</code> argument is used to scale the variables in the parallel coordinate plot by using <code>uniminmax</code> method. The method univariately scales each variable so the minimum of the variable is zero and the maximum is one.</li>
<li><code>alphaLines</code> argument is used to reduce the intensity of the line colour to 0.2. The permissible value range is between 0 to 1.</li>
<li><code>boxplot</code> argument is used to turn on the boxplot by using logical <code>TRUE</code>. The default is <code>FALSE</code>.</li>
<li><code>title</code> argument is used to provide the parallel coordinates plot a title.</li>

<p>Since <code>ggparcoord()</code> is developed by extending the <strong>ggplot2</strong> package, we can combine it with some of the ggplot2 functions when plotting a parallel coordinates.</p>
<p>Here, we use <code>facet_wrap()</code> of <strong>ggplot2</strong> to plot 10 small multiple parallel coordinates, where each plot represents one geographical region (e.g.&nbsp;“East Asia”).</p>
