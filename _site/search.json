It is designed for both frequentist and Bayesian uncertainty visualization, taking the view that uncertainty visualization can be unified through the perspective of distribution visualization.\nFor frequentist models, one visualises confidence distributions or bootstrap distributions (see vignette(“freq-uncertainty-vis”));\nFor Bayesian models, one visualises probability distributions (see the tidybayes package, which builds on top of ggdist).\n\nVisualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: stat_pointinterval()\nHere, we use stat_pointinterval() of ggdist to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.\n\nexam %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, \n             y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_pointinterval() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score\",\n    subtitle = \"Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function comes with many arguments.

We would do well to change the number of CI width arguments to better reflect the gradations.\nThe f values represent the probability density function, where a higher value (darker colour) indicates a region of higher probability density, meaning the estimated mean is more likely to be within that range, while a lower value (lighter colour) represents lower probability density, indicating greater uncertainty or less concentration of values in that region."

    "section": "Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot",
    "text": "Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot\nRidgeline plot (also known as Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nThe figure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English scores by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\nPlotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plots with R.\nIn this section, we will plot ridgeline plots by using the ggridges package. It provides two main geoms to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe following is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarying fill colors along the x axis\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis.

    "text": "Visualising Distribution with Raincloud Plot\nRaincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does\nIn this section, we create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\nPlotting a Half Eye graph\nFirst we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA\n\n\n\n\nAdding the boxplot with geom_boxplot()\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding the Dot Plots with stat_dots()\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinishing Touches\nLastly, coord_flip() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, theme_economist() of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look."

It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document.

Here, we shall work with the patchwork package, which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\npatchwork has a very simple syntax to create composite layouts easily.

For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs on top of each other,\n“|” operator to place plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating composite pictures with tags\npatchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities to identify subplots, as shown in the figure below.\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating picture inlays\nBesides providing functions to place plots next to each other, patchwork allows us to place one or several plots elements freely on top or below another plot with the inset_element() function.\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a composite figure with theme\nWe now combine patchwork with ggthemes for appealing visuals.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist() & theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 15))"

Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\n\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7,\n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear')"

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories. That’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as \nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\nInterpreting the Bayes Factor\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.

    "text": "FunnelPlotR methods\nThe FunnelPlotR package uses ggplot to generate funnel plots. It requires a numerator (events of interest), denominator (population to be considered) and group. The key arguments selected for customisation are: - limit: plot limits (95 or 99) - label_outliers: to label outliers (true or false) - Poisson_limits: to add Poisson limits to the plot - OD_adjust: to add overdispersed limits to the plot - xrange and yrange: to specify the range to display for axes, acting like a zoom function - Other aesthetic components such as graph title, axis labels etc\n\nFunnelPlotR methods: The basic plot\n\nfunnel_plot(\n  .data = covid19,\n  numerator = Death,\n  denominator = Positive,\n  group = `Sub-district`\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA funnel plot object with 267 points of which 1 are outliers. \nPlot is adjusted for overdispersion. \n\n\nThis creates a funnel plot object with 267 points, of which 0 are outliers. The plot has been adjusted for overdispersion, which is when the variance of a dataset is greater than what is expected under the given statistical model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\n\ngroup in this function is different from that of a scatterplot, which plots alll individual points.

The default layout of the corrgram is a symmetric matrix. The default colour scheme is diverging blue-red. Blue colours are used to represent pair variables with positive correlation coefficients and red colours are used to represent pair variables with negative correlation coefficients. The intensity of the colours or saturation is used to represent the strength of the correlation coefficient. Darker colours and larger circles indicate relatively stronger linear relationship between the paired variables. On the other hand, lighter colours and smaller circles indicates relatively weaker linear relationship.\n\n\nWorking with visual geometrics\nIn the corrplot package, there are seven visual geometrics (a parameter method) that can be used to encode the attribute values. They are: circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color and pie. The default is circle, but this default setting can be changed by using the method argument as shown below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"pie\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with layouts\ncorrplot() supports three layout types, namely: “full”, “upper” or “lower”. The default is “full” which displays the full matrix. The default setting can be changed by using the type argument of corrplot().\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can further customise the layout by using the diag argument to turn off the diagonal cells, and the tl.col argument to change the axis text label colour to black as shown below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         cl.cex = 0.8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther arguments would include tl.pos, tl.cex, tl.offset for the text labels, and cl.pos, cl.cex, cl.offset for the colour legend"

    "text": "Working with mixed layouts\nWith the corrplot package, it is possible to design corrgrams which are mixed: a visual matrix in one triangle and a numerical matrix in the other triangle. In order to create a coorgram with such mixed layout, corrplot.mixed(), a wrapped function for mixed visualisation styles will be used.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"n\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that arguments lower and upper are used to define the visualisation method used. In this case ellipses are used to map the lower half of the corrgram and numbers are used to map the upper half of the corrgram. The argument tl.pos is used to specify the placement of the axis label. Lastly, the diag argument is used to specify the glyph on the principal diagonal of the corrgram, in this case none.\n\nCombining corrgrams with the significant test\nIn statistical analysis, we are also interested to know which pair of variables have correlation coefficients which are statistically significant.\nWith the corrplot package, we can use the cor.mtest() function to compute the p-values and confidence interval for each pair of variables.\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\nWe can then use the p.mat argument of corrplot function to feed the calculated p-values into the visual.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above shows the corrgram combined with the significant test. The corrgram reveals that not all correlation pairs are statistically significant. For example the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and free surfur dioxide is statistically significant at a significance level of 0.05, but not the pair between total sulfur dioxide and citric acid.\n\n\nReordering a corrgram\nMatrix reordering is very important to mine the hiden structures and patterns in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-written by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package supports four sorting methods:\n\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details.\n“FPC” for the first principal component order.\n“hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used. “hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “ward.D”, “ward.D2”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.\n“alphabet” for alphabetical order.\n\nMore algorithms can be found in the seriation package.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReordering a correlation matrix using hclust\nIf using hclust, corrplot() can draw rectangles around the corrgram based on the results of hierarchical clustering.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 5)"

This is because the heatmap does a reordering using clusterisation: it calculates the distance between each pair of rows and columns and try to order them by similarity. Moreover, the corresponding dendrogram are provided beside the heatmap visualize how clusters are formed and how they merge at different levels of similarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nBy default, heatmap() plots a cluster heatmap.

    "text": "Creating Interactive Heatmaps\nheatmaply is an R package for building interactive cluster heatmaps that can be shared online as a stand-alone HTML file. It is designed and maintained by Tal Galili.\nIntroduction to Heatmaply provides an overall understanding of the features and functions of Heatmaply package. The user manual of the package also proves handy for reference purposes.\nIn this section, we will use heatmaply to design an interactive cluster heatmap. We will exclude the country, region and outliers from the heatmap.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nDifferent from heatmap(), for heatmaply() the default horizontal dendrogram is placed on the right hand side of the heatmap.\nThe text label of each row, on the other hand, is placed on the left hand side of the heat map.\nWhen the x-axis marker labels are too long, they will be rotated by 135 degrees from north.\n\n\n\n\nData trasformation\nWhen analysing multivariate data sets, it is very common that the variables in the data set includes values that reflect different types of measurements. In general, these variables’ values have their own range. In order to ensure that all the variables have comparable values, data transformation is commonly carried out before clustering.\nThe three main data transformation methods supported by heatmaply() are: scale, normalise and percentilse.\n\nScaling method\nWhen all variables come from or are assumed to come from some normal distribution, then scaling (i.e.: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) would bring them all close to the standard normal distribution. distribution. In such a case, each value would reflect the distance from the mean in units of standard deviation.\nThe scale argument in heatmaply() supports column and row scaling. In this visual we will scale variable values only columnwise:\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)],\n          scale = \"column\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalising method\nWhen variables in the data come from possibly different (and non-normal) distributions, the normalize function can be used to bring data to the 0 to 1 scale by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the maximum of all observations. This preserves the shape of each variable’s distribution while making them easily comparable on the same “scale”.\nDifferent from Scaling, the normalise method is performed on the entierty of the input data set i.e. on wh_matrix\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentising method\nThis is similar to ranking the variables, but instead of keeping the rank values, divide them by the maximal rank. This is done by using the empirical cumulative distribution function (ecdf) of the variables on their own values, bringing each value to its empirical percentile. The benefit of the percentize function is that each value has a relatively clear interpretation, which is the percent of observations that have that particular value or below.\nSimilarly to the Normalize method, the Percentize method is performed on the entierty of the input data set i.e. on wh_matrix\n\nheatmaply(percentize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClustering algorithms\nheatmaply supports a variety of hierarchical clustering algorithms. The main arguments are:\n\ndistfun: function used to compute the distance (dissimilarity) between both rows and columns. Defaults to dist. The options “pearson”, “spearman” and “kendall” can be used to use correlation-based clustering, which uses as.dist(1 - cor(t(x))) as the distance metric (using the specified correlation method).\nhclustfun: function used to compute the hierarchical clustering when Rowv or Colv are not dendrograms. Defaults to hclust.\ndist_method default is NULL, which results in “euclidean” to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to distfun. By default distfun is “dist”” hence this can be one of “euclidean”, “maximum”, “manhattan”, “canberra”, “binary” or “minkowski”.\nhclust_method default is NULL, which results in “complete” method being used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to hclustfun. By default hclustfun is hclust hence this can be one of “ward.D”, “ward.D2”, “single”, “complete”, “average” (= UPGMA), “mcquitty” (= WPGMA), “median” (= WPGMC) or “centroid” (= UPGMC).\n\nIn general, a clustering model can be calibrated either manually or statistically.\n\n\nThe Manual Approach\nHere, the heatmap is plotted by using a hierachical clustering algorithm with “Euclidean distance” and “ward.D” method.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistical Approach\nIn order to determine the best clustering method and number of clusters, the dend_expend() and find_k() functions of dendextend package will be used.\nFirst, dend_expend() will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.\n\nwh_d &lt;- dist(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), method = \"euclidean\")\n\ndend_expend(wh_d)[[3]]\n\n  dist_methods hclust_methods     optim\n1      unknown         ward.D 0.6137851\n2      unknown        ward.D2 0.6289186\n3      unknown         single 0.4774362\n4      unknown       complete 0.6434009\n5      unknown        average 0.6701688\n6      unknown       mcquitty 0.5020102\n7      unknown         median 0.5901833\n8      unknown       centroid 0.6338734\n\n\nThe output table shows that the “average” method should be used because it gives the highest value.\nNext, find_k() is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.\n\nwh_clust &lt;- hclust(wh_d, method = \"average\")\nnum_k &lt;- find_k(wh_clust)\nplot(num_k)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above shows that k=3 would be the optimum.\nWe then plot the heatmap with the optimum results.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"average\",\n          k_row = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriation\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. For example, with three items A, B and C, if you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It also doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nHere we have our first seriation algorithm: Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO). This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves. Here we see the result of applying Optimal Leaf Ordering to the same clustering result as the normalised heatmap above.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default option is “OLO” (Optimal leaf ordering) which optimizes the above criterion (in O(n^4)). Another option is “GW” (Gruvaeus and Wainer) which aims for the same goal but uses a potentially faster heuristic.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"GW\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “mean” option gives the output we would get by default from heatmap functions in other packages such as gplots’ heatmap.2.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “none” gives us the dendrograms without any rotation that is based on the data matrix.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with colour palettes\nThe The default colour palette uses by heatmaply is viridis. However, users can use other colour palettes in order to improve the aestheticness and visual friendliness of the heatmap.\nHere, we use the Blues colour palette of RColorBrewer package.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe finishing touch\nBesides providing a wide collection of arguments for meeting the statistical analysis needs, heatmaply also provides many plotting features to ensure a cartographic quality heatmap can be produced.\nIn the code chunk below the following arguments are used:\n\nk_row is used to produce 5 groups.\nmargins is used to change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200.\nfontsizw_row and fontsize_col are used to change the font size for row and column labels to 4.\nmain is used to write the main title of the plot.\nxlab and ylab are used to write the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.\n\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          Colv=NA,\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 5,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \\nDataTransformation using Normalise Method\",\n          xlab = \"World Happiness Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"World Countries\"\n          )"

    "text": "Plotting Static Parallel Coordinates\nIn this section, we will plot static parallel coordinates by using ggparcoord() of the GGally package.\n\nPlotting a simple parallel coordinates\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNotice that only two arguments, namely data and columns, are used. Data argument is used to map the data object (i.e. wh) and columns is used to select the columns for preparing the parallel coordinates.\n\n\n\n\nPlotting a parallel coordinates with boxplot\nThe basic parallel coordinates failed to reveal any meaningful information from the World Happiness measures. Hence, we provide a makeover to the plot by using a collection of arguments provided by ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Parallel Coordinates Plot of World Happines Variables\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\ngroupColumn argument is used to group the observations (i.e. parallel lines) by using a single variable (i.e. Region) and colour the parallel coordinates lines by region name.\nscale argument is used to scale the variables in the parallel coordinate plot by using uniminmax method. The method univariately scales each variable so the minimum of the variable is zero and the maximum is one.\nalphaLines argument is used to reduce the intensity of the line colour to 0.2. The permissible value range is between 0 to 1.\nboxplot argument is used to turn on the boxplot by using logical TRUE. The default is FALSE.\ntitle argument is used to provide the parallel coordinates plot a title.\n\n\n\n\n\nParallel coordinates with facet\nSince ggparcoord() is developed by extending the ggplot2 package, we can combine it with some of the ggplot2 functions when plotting a parallel coordinates.\nHere, we use facet_wrap() of ggplot2 to plot 10 small multiple parallel coordinates, where each plot represents one geographical region (e.g. “East Asia”).\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) +\n  theme(strip.text = element_text(size = 8))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the aesthetic defects of the current design is that most of the variable names overlap on x-axis.\n\n\nRotating x-axis text label\nTo make the x-axis text label easy to read, we will rotate the labels by 30 degrees. We can rotate axis text labels using the theme() function in ggplot2 as shown below\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) +\n  theme(strip.text = element_text(size = 8),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, size = 6))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\nTo rotate x-axis text labels, we use axis.text.x as an argument to the theme() function. We specify element_text(angle = 30) to rotate the x-axis text by an angle of 30 degrees, and size = 6 to make the font size smaller.\n\n\n\n\nAdjusting the rotated x-axis text label\nRotating x-axis text labels to 30 degrees makes the label overlap with the plot. We can avoid this by adjusting the text location using the hjust argument to theme’s text element with element_text(). We use axis.text.x as we want to change the look of x-axis text.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) +\n  theme(strip.text = element_text(size = 8),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, size = 6, hjust = 1))"
